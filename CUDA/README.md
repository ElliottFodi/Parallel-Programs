I have not included execute instructions as this is just to be used as an example.
The program has been tested and verified, it does produce the correct results.
I made this program in a class I was taking and we were required to use the 
professors libraries.("Util.cu"
 and "Random.cu") I do not have permission to 
distribute the libraries, this is why I have not included run instructions.
