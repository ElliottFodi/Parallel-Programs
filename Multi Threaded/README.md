I have not included execute instructions as this is just to be used as an example.
The program has been tested and verified, it does produce the correct results.
I made this program in a class I was taking and we were required to use the 
professors libraries. I do not have permission to distribute the libraries, this 
is why I have not included run instructions. Information on the pj2 library can be 
found here http://www.cs.rit.edu/~ark/654/.
